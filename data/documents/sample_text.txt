Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a broad field of computer science focused on creating systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation.

Machine Learning is a subset of AI that involves training algorithms to recognize patterns in data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. There are several types of machine learning:

1. Supervised Learning: Algorithms learn from labeled training data
2. Unsupervised Learning: Algorithms find patterns in unlabeled data
3. Reinforcement Learning: Algorithms learn through trial and error

Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers to process data. Neural networks are inspired by the human brain's structure and function.

Key Concepts:
- Algorithms: Mathematical procedures for solving problems
- Training Data: Datasets used to teach algorithms
- Models: Trained algorithms that can make predictions
- Accuracy: Measure of how well a model performs

Applications of AI include:
- Natural language processing for chatbots
- Computer vision for image recognition
- Recommendation systems for personalized content
- Autonomous vehicles for transportation
- Medical diagnosis for healthcare

The field continues to evolve rapidly with new breakthroughs in areas like generative AI, large language models, and multimodal learning.
