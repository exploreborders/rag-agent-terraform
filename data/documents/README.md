# Sample Documents for RAG Agent Testing

## Overview

This directory contains sample documents to test the RAG Agent system's document processing capabilities. These files demonstrate different content types and formats that the system can handle.

## Files Included

### `sample_text.txt`
A plain text document explaining artificial intelligence and machine learning concepts.

**Key Features:**
- Basic text formatting
- Technical terminology
- Educational content
- Approximately 500 words

### `sample_markdown.md`
A markdown document demonstrating structured content with various markdown elements.

**Key Features:**
- Headers and subheaders (# ## ###)
- Code blocks (```)
- Lists (ordered and unordered)
- Links and emphasis
- Approximately 300 words

### `sample_code.py`
A Python script with functions, classes, and documentation.

**Key Features:**
- Function definitions with docstrings
- Class definitions
- Import statements
- Comments and type hints
- Approximately 150 lines of code

## Testing Instructions

1. Upload these documents to test different processing capabilities
2. Query about AI/ML concepts from the text document
3. Ask about markdown formatting from the markdown document
4. Query about code functionality from the Python file

## Expected Results

After uploading, you should be able to ask questions like:
- "What is artificial intelligence?"
- "How does machine learning work?"
- "Show me examples of markdown formatting"
- "What functions are defined in the code?"

The system should return relevant chunks with similarity scores and generate coherent answers based on the document content.
